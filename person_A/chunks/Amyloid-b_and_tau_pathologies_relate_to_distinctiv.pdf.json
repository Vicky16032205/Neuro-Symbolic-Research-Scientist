Gazzaniga The human brain is composed of functional networks that have a modular topology, where brain regions are organized into communities that form internally dense (segre- gated) and externally sparse (integrated) subnetworks that underlie higher-order cogni- tive functioning. It is hypothesized that amyloid- \u03b2and tau pathology in preclinical Alzheimer \u2019s disease (AD) spread through functional networks, disrupting neural com- munication that results in cognitive dysfunction. We used high-resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses to test whether in vivo amyloid- \u03b2and tau burden was associated with the segregation and integration of brain functional connections, andepisodic memory, in cognitively unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers who are expected to develop early-onset AD dementia in \u223c13 y on average. Compared to non- carriers, mutation carriers exhibited less functional segregation and integration in poste-rior default-mode network (DMN) regions, particularly the precuneus, and in the retrospenial cortex, which has been shown to link medial temporal regions and cortical regions of the DMN. Mutation carriers also showed greater functional segregation andintegration in regions connected to the salience network, including the striatum and thalamus. Greater tau burden was associated with lower segregated and integrated func- tional connectivity of DMN regions, particularly the precuneus and medial prefrontalcortex. In turn, greater tau pathology was related to higher segregated and integratedfunctional connectivity in the retrospenial cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the salience network. These \ufb01ndings enlighten our understanding of how AD-related pathology distinctly alters the brain \u2019s functional architecture in the preclini- cal stage, possibly contributing to pathology propagation and ultimately resulting in dementia. familial Alzheimer \u2019s disease jfMRI jpositron emission tomography jpathology jresting-state functional connectivity The progressive accumulation of amyloid- \u03b2plaques and neuro \ufb01brillary tangles in Alz- heimer \u2019s disease (AD) begins several years before symptom onset (i.e., the preclinical stage) (1, 2) and follows distinct spatiotemporal patterns (3, 4). Amyloid- \u03b2accumulates throughout anatomically distant neocortical regions approximately two decades before the onset of memory impairment (2, 5), whereas tau accumulation is \ufb01rst observed in the transentorhinal and entorhinal cortex, later spreading into adjacent association and unimodal cortices (6 \u20138). These patterns of pathology accumulation are highly reminis- cent of functional brain networks, which can be represented by the interregional coher- ence of spontaneous neural activity \ufb02uctuations during rest using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This has led some to hypothesize that pathology propaga- tion in AD may occur through functional networks (9 \u201311). In vivo neuroimaging stud- ies have shown that amyloid- \u03b2\ufb01rst accumulates in a set of distributed brain regions that form part of the so-called default mode network", "(DMN) (i.e., precuneus, medial prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices), which is considered a backbone of mainly cor- tical integration (12, 13). Conversely, tau pathology begins to accumulate in vulnerable loci, later advancing to local functionally connected regions, possibly following transsy- naptic spread along functional connections (8, 9, 14). As such, characterizing how AD-related pathology relates to the brain \u2019s functional architecture in the preclinical stage of AD can improve our understanding of the impact of pathology on neural com-munication and propagation early in the disease and help with early detection, disease staging, and prediction of cognitive decline. Some functional brain networks have been shown to undergo two distinct phases that are differentially associated with AD stages. Some studies have reported increasedSIGNIFICANCE Amyloid- \u03b2and tau, hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer \u2019s disease (AD), are hypothesized to spreadthrough brain functional networksthat are critical for neuralcommunication.

Some DMN regions, particularly the precuneus, have also been shown to act as mediators between hyperconnected and hypoconnected hubs (16), which are brain regions that are highly interconnected and that act asway stations to integrate information across different and oftensegregated or distributed neural systems. While some studieshave suggested an inverse relationship between tau deposition and functional connectivity (16, 18), others have shown that elevated tau deposition is associated with stronger local func-tional connectivity early in AD (10, 19, 20). Greater functionalconnectivity in tau pathology hotspots have been related to a faster accumulation of tau in interconnected regions, suggesting that functional connectivity in regions that accumulate taufaster and earlier may enable the spread of tau to nearby struc-tures that are closely functionally connected (10, 19, 21). These complex brain networks have a modular organization \u2014 i.e., different voxels of the brain are organized in communitiesthat specialize on distinct tasks. These modules have a large num- ber", "of links that connect voxels within a community (network seg- regation) and a smaller set of links that integrate informationbetween communities (network integration). However, very littleis known about how early AD-related pathology \u2014particularly tau pathology, a strong predictor of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline (22 \u201324)\u2014distinctly impacts the integration and segrega- tion of networks crucial for ef \ufb01cient information processing. Most of the published research has been limited by focusing on amyloid- \u03b2and not tau and by studying older adults who are at high risk but may not develop AD dementia. Furthermore, manystudies have examined functional connectivity by averaging sets ofpair-wise correlations, thereby obscuring the intricate dynamics offunctional networks and potential effects on cognitive functioning in the preclinical stage of AD. To address these shortcomings in the \ufb01eld, we used high- resolution (voxel-level) graph-based network analyses to charac- terize the topological organization of functional connections inthe brain associated with in vivo amyloid- \u03b2and tau burden and episodic memory in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) caused by the Presenilin-1 ( PSEN1 ) E280A mutation. Studying ADAD provides a unique opportunity to understandthe associations between AD-related pathology and functionalconnections in preclinical AD, as mutation carriers are virtuallyguaranteed to develop dementia and have limited age-related comorbidities that could contribute to brain dysfunction. PSEN1 E280A carriers have a well-characterized clinical pro \ufb01le, with an onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at a medianage of 44 y and dementia at 49 y (25). They exhibit widespread cortical amyloid- \u03b2accumulation approximately two decades before estimated MCI onset, and tau pathology in the entorhi-nal cortex close to 6 y before estimated MCI onset (2, 24).They also show reduced glucose metabolism in temporal and parietal regions, including in the precuneus, more than a decade before estimated MCI onset (26). We computed a data-driven voxel-level whole-brain analysis to create maps of functional hubs that help characterize segre- gated (within-network) and integrated (between-network) con-nections. We examined whether the segregation and integrationof functional networks at resting differed between mutation carriers and age-matched noncarrier family members and their relationship to AD-related pathology burden and episodicmemory. We also used a brain parcellation approach to localizethe surviving links in our results and match them to well- known canonical resting-state networks. Amyloid- \u03b2and tau burden were measured with 11C Pittsburg compound B and[F18] Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET), respectively. We hypothesized that there would be signi \ufb01cant group differences in the segregation and integration of func- tional connections in DMN regions, particularly in the precu- neus and medial temporal regions. We also hypothesized that less segregated functional connectivity would be associated with greater tau burden and worse episodic memory and strongerintegrated functional connectivity with higher amyloid- \u03b2bur- den and worse episodic memory. Results Sample Characteristics. We examined 21 cognitively unim- paired PSEN1 E280A carriers who were on average 8 y from expected symptom onset and 13 y from expected dementia onset and 31 noncarriers. The groups did not signi \ufb01cantly dif- fer in age, education, sex, or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (Table 1). Compared to", "noncarriers, mutation carriers performed signi \ufb01cantly worse than noncarriers in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer \u2019s Disease (CERAD) word list delayed recall, a measure of episodic mem- ory that is sensitive to early cognitive changes in this population (F(1, 49) =7.87, P=0.007, d=0.73) (Table 1) (25). Segregated and Integrated Functional Connectivity Patterns Differ between Cognitively Unimpaired Mutation Carriers and Noncarriers. We\ufb01rst examined whether there were dis- tinct patterns of segregated and integrated functional connectiv- ity between groups. Higher values in segregated functional connectivity maps denote that a given voxel has a greater num- ber of strongly functionally connected links to other regions of the same functional network, whereas higher values in inte-grated functional connectivity maps mean that the voxel is an important hub for integrating information between brain communities. Compared to noncarriers, mutation carriers exhibited less functional segregation and integration of posterior DMN regions that subserve episodic memory (Fig. 1). Speci \ufb01cally, we observed less segregated and integrated functional connectivity in the precuneus, a hub of the DMN that is vulnerable to early tau accumulation in this cohort (24). We also found less inte- grated functional connectivity in the retrospenial cortex, which has been suggested to link subcortical systems (i.e., medial tem-poral regions) and cortical regions of the DMN (27). This \ufb01nd- ing suggests that the precuneus is functionally disconnected from regions within network as well as other brain communi- ties, while the retrospenial cortex is disconnected from regions across networks. We then conducted two seed-based post hoc analyses of the fMRI data to better characterize functional connectivity pat- terns of these two regions ( SI Appendix ). The precuneus seed exhibited less functional segregation with other DMN regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal, and temporal and medial frontal cortex. On the other hand, the ret-rosplenial cortex exhibited less functional integration with regions from the salience network, as well as the hippocampus and brainstem ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ). Notably, the observed dysconnectivity of these structures with other brain regions is unlikely due to atrophy, a marker of neurodegeneration, as we did not observe signi \ufb01cant atrophy in any of the posterior regions ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). This result suggests that the 2o f8 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113641119 pnas.org observed functional changes precede neurodegeneration and may instead be associated with other pathophysiological pro-cesses, such as the accumulation of tau pathology, as we reportin the next section. Mutation carriers also exhibited greater segregated and inte- grated functional connectivity of mostly salience network regionscompared to noncarriers (Fig. 1). Speci \ufb01cally, we observed greater segregation in the thalamus and integration in the striatum,medial frontal cortex, and paracentral lobule. This \ufb01nding suggeststhat the thalamus is hyperconnected to within-network regions and the other regions to other brain communities. Amyloid- \u03b2and tau Burden Are Distinctively Associated with Functional Connectivity Maps in Cognitively UnimpairedMutation Carriers. We then examined the association between functional segregation and integration patterns with AD pro-gression in the preclinical stage.

First, we found that the precuneus, inferior temporal, and entorhinal cortices had the greatest accumulation of tau pathol-ogy in mutation carriers compared to noncarriers (Fig. 2 A), as previously reported (24). We then examined how tau burden in these regions related to segregated and integrated functional connectivity in mutation carriers. We found that greater tauburden in these brain structures was associated with less segre-gated and integrated functional connectivity of DMN regions(SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ), particularly the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the lateral occipital cortex (Fig.2B). That is, greater tau burden was related to a greater disrup- tion and reduction in connectivity of these regions within thenetwork and across brain communities. In turn, more tau accumulation was associated with greater segregated and integrated functional connectivity in the retro- spenial cortex and integrated functional connectivity in theanterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a hub of the salience network(Fig. 2 B). This \ufb01nding suggests that, as tau accumulates, the retrospenial cortex becomes highly connected to regions withinnetwork and across brain communities, while the ACCbecomes more functionally connected to regions within net- work only. We then proceeded to examine the relationship between the functional segregation and integration of each of these regions(i.e., precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, lateral occipital cor- tex, retrospenial cortex, and the ACC), with amyloid- \u03b2and tau pathology. Because amyloid- \u03b2pathology accumulates in the cortex more than a decade before tau does on this kindred,looking at the relationship", "between amyloid- \u03b2and tau with the functional segregation and integration of these regions mayprovide insight into how functional connections change with disease progression. Results suggest that there is greater func- tional segregation and integration of the retrospenial cortex andintegration of the ACC in the presence of tau pathology com-pared to amyloid- \u03b2burden (Fig. 2 B), while the opposite is true for the segregation and integration of DMN regions. Functional Connectivity Alterations Are Associated with Worse Episodic Memory in Cognitively Unimpaired MutationCarriers. Finally, we investigated whether functional brain maps were related to the CERAD word list delayed recall scores in mutation carriers. We found that higher delayed recall scoreswere signi \ufb01cantly associated with higher segregated functional Fig. 2. Relationship of segregated and integrated network connectivity, with amyloid- \u03b2and tau pathology in mutation carriers. We used a bipartite graph theory approach to investigate the association between whole-brain PET imaging and resting-state fMRI in mutation carriers.

The Bottom part of Ashows the bipartite graph approach that we employed on this study to test the relationship between tau burden and functional connectivity patterns.

We also observed that higher delayed recall scores were related to lower integrated functional connectivity in the precuneus and medialprefrontal cortex and with greater integrated functional connec-tivity in the precentral cortex. We then examined whetherfunctional connectivity mediated the relationship betweenpathology and delayed recall scores or whether pathology medi- ated the relationship between functional connectivity and delayed recall scores. We did not \ufb01nd a relationship, as none of the regions survived correction for multiple comparisons. Discussion We provide in vivo evidence that amyloid- \u03b2and tau patholo- gies relate to distinct patterns of functional segregation andintegration that resemble the patterns of pathology accumula-tion in AD and relate to episodic memory in preclinicalADAD. We found that posterior DMN regions, particularly the precuneus, one of", "the earliest sites of pathology accumula- tion in ADAD, and the retrospenial cortex exhibited signi \ufb01- cantly less functional segregation and integration of networkscompared to age-matched noncarriers. This decrease in func-tional segregation and integration of the precuneus with other regions within network and across brain communities were also strongly associated with greater tau burden in the entorhinalcortex, precuneus, and inferior temporal gyrus and less toamyloid- \u03b2, suggesting that dysconnectivity of the precuneus occurs closer to symptom onset and may play a pivotal role inpredicting disease progression early. Similarly, the medial pre- frontal cortex, which is part of the DMN, exhibited lesssegregated and integrated functional connectivity in relation to greater tau burden in the same regions. Both the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex are core hubs of the DMN and support complex cognition and behav-iors such as episodic memory (28 \u201330). Prior studies have suggested that individuals at high risk for AD exhibit hypercon-nectivity in the DMN, before a reduction in functional con-nectivity is observed (15). In fact, we previously reported thatchildren ages 9 to 17 who carry the E280A mutation exhibitedincreased functional connectivity of DMN regions compared toage-matched noncarriers (31). This hyperconnectivity phase has been most strongly associated with amyloid- \u03b2pathology and the hypoconnectivity phase most strongly related to tau pathol-ogy burden (15). Prior studies with other ADAD mutationshave also reported decreased functional DMN segregation asindividuals approach symptom onset. One particular studydemonstrated decreased functional connectivity of the precu-neus and other posterior DMN regions in cognitively unim-paired mutation carriers (32), while another showed that bothanterior and posterior regions of the network are disruptedearly (33). Notably, other studies have only observed less func-tional connectivity, including in the DMN and between net-works, in cognitively impaired mutation carriers as measuredby a score of 1 on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale,and not in cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers (CDR = 0) (11, 13). These studies measured functional connectivity byeither calculating a global resting-state functional connectivitysignature (11) or composite scores comprised of regions chosena priori (13). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the voxel-wise connec- tivity analyses conducted in this study provide high-resolutionconnectome information that increases the sensitivity to detect Fig. 3. Association between segregated and integrated network connectivity, and word list delayed recall in mutation carriers. We conducted a general lin- ear model to evaluate the functional connectivity patterns associated with word list delayed recall scores in mutation carriers. Regions that were a ssociated but did not survive multiple comparisons (Z >1.64; P<0.1) are displayed on the brain, with black borders indicating regions that survived multiple compari- sons ( P<0.05). Red-yellow colors illustrate an association between better delayed recall scores and greater functional connectivity, and blue colors illu strate a relationship between better delayed recall scores and less functional connectivity. Scatterplots illustrate the relationship of word list delay ed recall scores with functional connectivity in regions that survived multiple comparisons. MPFC, medial prefrontal cortex. PNAS 2022 Vol. 119 No. 15 e2113641119 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113641119 5o f8 subtle disease-related changes that occur in the preclinical stage of AD. Similar to", "the DMN, the salience network has also been shown to undergo a phase of hyperconnectivity associated with mostly amyloid- \u03b2, followed by hypoconnectivity (15). Consis- tent with these \ufb01ndings, mutation carriers exhibited greater seg- regated functional connectivity in regions connected to thesalience network such as the thalamus and greater functionalintegration in the striatum. Similarly, greater tau burden was related to greater functional integration of the ACC, a salience network hub. While some studies have not observed changes inthe salience network in preclinical AD, others have suggestedthat the salience network becomes disrupted early in ADAD (33) and that it is particularly vulnerable to early AD-related changes together with the DMN. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that some salience network regions (ACC and striatum) are hyper-connected to other brain communities in the preclinical stage of AD and others (thalamus) to within network. It is possible that the observed segregated hyperconnectivity serves as a pre-dictor for future pathology accumulation, as animal studieshave demonstrated that neuron-to-neuron propagation of taupathology is facilitated by greater synaptic connectivity and neuronal activity (21, 34). The same can be said for the retro- spenial cortex, which is strongly connected to medial temporalregions that subserve episodic memory. Perhaps these connec-tions will weaken with time, when tau aggregates in these regions as most of them are primarily affected by amyloid- \u03b2at this stage. In regard to the relationship between functional connectivity and episodic memory, we observed that less integrated func-tional connectivity in the precuneus and medial prefrontal cor-tex was associated with better memory test scores. That is,mutation carriers with better episodic memory exhibited hypo- connectivity of these two DMN regions when integrating infor- mation with other networks of the brain. We also found asigni\ufb01cant relationship between greater functional integrity in the left middle frontal gyrus and better episodic memory. While these \ufb01ndings may appear to con \ufb02ict with the observed patterns in functional connectivity associated with pathology ata\ufb01rst glance, prior research suggests that hyperconnectivity in the left frontal cortex may represent a compensatory mecha- nism or form of neural reserve. Speci \ufb01cally, in a study examin- ing individuals with ADAD and sporadic AD researchersreported that greater functional connectivity in the left frontalcortex was associated with less cognitive decline and global cog-nition, as well as a diminished effect of tau on cognitive perfor- mance in the presence of greater left frontal cortex connectivity in the early stages of AD (35). As such, we hypothesize that theobserved hyperconnectivity of the left frontal cortex associatedwith better episodic memory may re \ufb02ect a form of compensa- tion or neural reserve in the preclinical stage of AD. Altogether, our \ufb01ndings suggest that in the presence of tau pathology, mutation carriers exhibit largely dysconnectivity of DMN brain regions, particularly posterior regions, andincreased connectivity of structures that are associated with thesalience network and others that are critical for integratinginformation across neural systems. Based on data that have been reported and our own \ufb01ndings, one could hypothesize that elevated amyloid- \u03b2levels contribute to an increase in func- tional connectivity or neuronal", "\ufb01ring between the precuneus and other DMN regions, and later for salience networks regions, increasing the vulnerability of these regions for early tau deposition in ADAD, and later becoming disconnected inthe presence of tau pathology, further contributing to cognitivedecline. Studying the relationship between AD-related pathol- ogy and the functional organization of the brain in youngermutation carriers, as well as longitudinally, may provide theopportunity to test the aforementioned hypothesis. The current study has multiple strengths. First, we did not rely on presenting symptoms or predicted risk (e.g., based onamyloid- \u03b2PET levels or APOE genotype) to infer whether individuals will develop dementia. Instead, we tested ourhypotheses with individuals who have a well-characterized dis-ease and clinical trajectory. In addition, we examined in vivo amyloid- \u03b2and tau pathology using PET imaging, which is con- sidered the gold standard for quantifying and mapping brainpathology in AD. Mutation carriers were also young and other-wise generally healthy, which minimizes potential age-relatedconfounding variables that contribute to brain dysfunction andcognitive decline (e.g., cardiovascular disease). Furthermore, weconducted voxel-level connectivity analyses, which provide high-resolution connectome information that increases the sen- sitivity to detect subtle disease-related changes that occur in thepreclinical stage of AD. However, we also used a parcellationscheme to localize the surviving links in our analyses and matchthem to 7 well-known canonical resting-state networks. Finally,the very homogeneous clinical pro \ufb01le of mutation carriers allowed us to infer how functional connections may change as the disease progresses. The present study also has caveats that must be considered when interpreting the data. First, our sample size is relativelysmall compared to other studies of AD. However, individualswith these mutations are relatively rare and all our participants carry a single mutation, which makes our sample highly homo- geneous compared to other cohorts, and one of the largest sin-gle mutation ADAD samples with PET imaging and fMRI.Nonetheless, our \ufb01ndings should be validated on larger ADAD samples in the future. Furthermore, more research is needed toexamine whether our \ufb01ndings in ADAD generalize to preclini- cal late-onset AD, as well as whether other genetic risk factors known to be important may impact the results in this kindred.We are currently conducting a longitudinal biomarker studywith this cohort, which will provide greater insight into how anannual change in functional connectivity relates to in vivopathology burden and cognitive decline over time. Altogether, these \ufb01ndings highlight the importance of not limiting analyses to examining group averages or speci \ufb01 c seeds, as they can obscure the unique and often subtle patterns offunctional disintegration associated with disease progression.Our data also underscore that more attention must be given tothe precuneus as an early marker of AD and key player in func- tional dysconnectivity. Our \ufb01ndings enlighten our understand- ing of how AD-related pathology may distinctly alter thefunctional architecture of the brain to interfere with the inte-gration of information within and across different neural sys-tems and possibly propagate the spread of pathology, ultimatelyresulting in cognitive impairment and dementia. Materials and Methods Study Design and Participants.

Neuropsychological Measures. A Spanish version of the CERAD word list learning test that is sensitive to early episodic memory changes in mutation car-riers was used in this study (37). On this test, participants were required to learn10 items over 3 trials. Participants were then asked to recall as many words asthey could from the previously learned list after a 10-min delay (delayed recallscore). Higher scores on the delayed recall represent better performance on thememory task. MRI and PET Data Acquisition and Preprocessing.

Based on this modular organization, the brain \u2019s functional con- nectivity can be separated in 1) segregated links connecting all the voxelsbelonging to the same community and 2) integrated links connecting links ofeach voxel with the rest of the communities of the brain for higher cognitiveintegration. A whole-brain functional connectivity matrix was computed using the Pearson rcorrelation coef \ufb01cient in the time series of each pair of voxels. A 49,314 \u00d7 49,314 association matrix was obtained for each participant, and negative valueswere removed (14, 16). The 49,314 gray matter voxels included cortical, subcor-tical, brainstem, and cerebellum regions. We generated a whole brain sevenresting-state network parcellation to classify each link in the connectivity matrixas segregation or integration. The seven resting-state networks of the Yeo parcel-lation were used as the initial seed to extend these networks to also cover sub-cortical, brainstem, and cerebellar regions (39). We generated a parcellation scheme taking advance of the same", "acquisition scanner and sequences offered by our local database Brain Genomics SuperstructProject Open Access (GSP) (40) based on a sample of 100 participants.Individual-subject seed connectivity was computed for visual, sensory-motor, dor-sal attention (lateral-visual), ventral attention (salience), limbic, frontoparietal,and DMNs. The average population map of each network was calculated, andeach voxel of the atlas was assigned to each network based on the maximumprobability of each voxel belonging to each of the networks ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). If the link \u2019s start and end voxels belonged to the same resting state network, the link was then classi \ufb01ed as a segregated link; otherwise, the link was classi \ufb01ed as an integrated link. For each participant, we computed the weighted degree of segregated and integrated links separately obtainingtwo brain maps, namely, one for each connectivity type (41). The weighteddegree represents the strength of connections that each voxel in the brainhas. Higher values in the segregated map means that a given voxel has ahigh number of strong connecting links to other regions of the same func-tional network. On the other hand, high values in the integrated map meanthat this voxel is an important hub for integration of information betweenbrain communities. Statistical Analyses Demographics and cognition. We conducted independent samples ttests using SPSS Statistics, version 24.0 (IBM Corp.) to examine group differences indemographic and cognitive variables. We used the \u03c7 2test to examine sex andFAST differences between groups. Analyses used a family-wise signi \ufb01cance threshold of P<0.05 to correct for multiple comparisons and Cohen \u2019sdto cal- culate effect sizes. Segregation and integration group differences. We used a general linear model to compute a two-sample ttest to compare segregation and integration weighted degree maps between the mutation carriers and the noncarriers, covarying for motion (MATLAB V9.6; The MathWorks, Inc.). Whole-brain correc-tion for multiple comparisons was applied using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations to estimate the probability of false-positive clusters with a two- tailed P<0.05 (3dClustSim, https://afni.nimh.nih.gov ). Association between resting-state fMRI and PET images. We used a bipartite graph approach to examine the association between amyloid- \u03b2and tau burden and functional segregation and integration in mutation carriers (Fig. 2). Since the bipartite graph approach is computationally complex, we downsampled PET a n df M R Is e g r e g a t i o na n di n t e g r a t i o nm a p st o6m m( 6 , 7 7 9v o x e l s ) .W e employed a linear general model, adjusting for motion in fMRI, to measure the relationship between PET burden in a speci \ufb01c voxel and the segregation and integration in another voxel, for each pair of PET and fMRI voxels. We obtained four different association matrices, as follows: 1) relationship of tau with func- tional segregation, 2) relationship of tau with functional integration, 3) relation- ship of amyloid- \u03b2with functional segregation, and 4) relationship of amyloid- \u03b2 with functional integration. We then adapted the cluster-level Monte Carlo multi-ple", "comparison correction technique to bipartite networks to control for type I errors of bipartite graphs at the link level. Only clusters of PET voxels (group of contiguous voxels with signi \ufb01cant association) that connected to a cluster of fMRI voxels with a minimum size survived multiple comparison. To estimate the mini- mum size of a PET cluster and fMRI cluster to be signi \ufb01cant with a P<0.05 we generated 10,000 bipartite random networks with the same smoothing proper- ties. We computed the likelihood of signi \ufb01cant cluster sizes due to chance in the generated random network and only those with a P<0.05 were reported. The endpoints of the links that survived multiple comparisons are displayed in both the PET and fMRI modality in Fig. 2. Functional integration and segregation association with episodic memory. We conducted a general linear model to examine the relationship betweenweighted degree maps in mutation carriers and the CERAD word list delayed recall, covarying for motion (MATLAB V9.6; The MathWorks, Inc.). A whole-brain correction for multiple comparisons was applied using Monte Carlo simulationwith 10,000 iterations to estimate the probability of false-positive clusters with a two-tailed P<0.05 (3dClustSim, https://afni.nimh.nih.gov ).
