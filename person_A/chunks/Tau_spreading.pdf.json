Here, by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal molecular imaging and network connectivity analyses in living humans, we identi\ufb01ed two amyloid-beta/tauinteractions associated with the onset and propagation of tau spreading. First, we show that the lateralentorhinal cortex, an early site of tau neuro\ufb01brillary tangle formation, is subject to remote, connectivity-medi-ated amyloid-beta/tau interactions linked to initial tau spreading. Second, we identify the inferior temporalgyrus as the region featuring the greatest local amyloid-beta/tau interactions and a connectivity pro\ufb01lewell suited to accelerate tau propagation. Taken together, our data address long-standing questionsregarding the topographical dissimilarity between early amyloid-beta and tau deposition. INTRODUCTION Brain parenchymal amyloid-beta (A b) deposition and tau neuro-", "\ufb01brillary tangle formation are the de\ufb01ning pathological features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) ( Braak et al., 2006 ;Jagust, 2018 ; Musiek and Holtzman, 2012 ). Abhas been proposed to trigger tau spreading ( Musiek and Holtzman, 2012 ;Jagust, 2018 ), but the spatial incongruity of A band tau during early AD has cast doubt on this hypothesis ( Jagust, 2018 ). Whereas A bdeposition begins in heteromodal association neocortices ( Thal et al., 2002 ), the earliest forebrain neuro\ufb01brillary tangles are seen within the lateral entorhinal cortex (EC) ( Hyman et al., 1984 ). From there, tau spreads into other mesial temporal memory structures butrarely beyond the basal temporal cortex in the absence of widespread neocortical A bdeposition ( Crary et al., 2014 ; Johnson et al., 2016 ;Sanchez et al., 2021a ). Considering these observations, how can remote neocortical A bin\ufb02uence earlypathological tau, triggering it to leave the EC? How, in turn, does A bfacilitate widespread tau propagation throughout the neocortex? Recent in vivo evidence supports the view that tau pathophys- iology exhibits a nonlinear acceleration during the natural history of AD ( McDade et al., 2018 ;Jack et al., 2010 ), and understanding the basis for this acceleration represents an important priority for AD research. Human post-mortem ( Braak and Del Tredici, 2011 ; Kim et al., 2020 ),in vivo brain imaging ( Zhou et al., 2012 ;Raj et al., 2015 ;Brown et al., 2019 ;Vogel et al., 2020 ;Ossenkoppele et al., 2019 ;Franzmeier et al., 2020 ), and model-based ( Liu et al., 2012 ;Clavaguera et al., 2013 ) studies have converged to sug- gest that transneuronal tau spreading likely contributes to theprogressive large-scale network degeneration seen in AD and other tau-based disorders. We, and others, have used the normative functional and structural connectome to predict thespatial patterning and spread of atrophy ( Zhou et al., 2012 ;Raj 1932 Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943, June 15, 2022 \u00aa2022 Elsevier Inc.ll et al., 2012 ,2015 ), and early tau-positron emission tomography (PET) studies suggest connectivity-related tau patterning in AD(Ossenkoppele et al., 2019 ;Vogel et al., 2020 ;Sepulcre et al., 2018 ). To date, however, no study has provided a connectivity- based molecular-anatomical framework for understanding theonset and acceleration of tau spreading in AD. In this study, we combined in vivo molecular imaging and large-scale brain network mapping techniques to address the long-standing questions of how regional A band tau interact to promote the onset and acceleration of tau spreading in individ- uals with presymptomatic and prodromal AD. Our \ufb01ndings sug- gest that (1) remote A bincites tau spreading by interacting, via long-range connections, with tau in the EC whereas (2) local Ab\u2013tau interactions in the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) facilitate widespread, connectivity-based tau propagation into neocor-tical regions that become tau-positive during the tauacceleration phase. RESULTSEarly entorhinal tauopathy and exponential tau acceleration during prodromal ADTo capture the nonlinear acceleration of AD tau spreading (Figure 1 A), we studied individuals enrolled in a multicenter observational study, the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI),who underwent", "cross-sectional 18F-\ufb02orbetapir-PET (henceforth \u2018\u2018amyloid-PET\u2019\u2019) and18F-\ufb02ortaucipir-PET (henceforth \u2018\u2018tau- PET\u2019\u2019) imaging (see Table 1 ). First, we mapped regions of tau- PET positivity in presymptomatic (A b+, cognitively normal [CN], n = 67) and prodromal AD (A b+, early [n = 28] and late [n = 17] mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; see STAR Methods ). Tau-PET positivity in presymptomatic AD was mild, but the EC (A28/34, A35/36r) stood out as a region with high mean tau-PET signal (Figure 1 B). This tau-PET mapping approach also revealed the expected sharp increase in brain-wide tau deposition in patients with late MCI. Second, we calculated the number of tau-positive brain regions for each subject within these groups (see STAR Methods ). Based on the resulting frequency distribution for regional tau burden, we constructed a pseudo-longitudinal disease severity order, with the least severe subjects being thosewith the fewest tau-PET-positive regions. This approach identi-\ufb01ed the EC (A28/34, A35/36r) as the earliest region to become tau-positive, based on the frequency distribution within each hemisphere. Overall, these approaches, which use cross-sectional data to make longitudinal inferences, converged to broadly reproduce the canonical stages of tau neuro\ufb01brillary tangle formation inferred from human neuropathological studies(Braak and Braak, 1991 ) (see Table S1 ). Most importantly, this dataset enabled us to identify an apparent \u2018\u2018acceleration phase\u2019\u2019 of exponential spreading in the spatial extent of tau-PET Figure 1. Pseudo-longitudinal tau regional spreading order (A) Dynamic biomarker models of AD ( Jack et al., 2010 ;Leuzy et al., 2019 ) propose that tau aggregation undergoes nonlinear acceleration in early MCI. (B) Tau-PET data from the ADNI cohort (present study) support this concept by demonstrating a sharp increase in brain-wide tau deposition that begins in Ab+ subjects with early MCI and accelerates in late MCI. Color bar in A b+ CN inset indicates tau-PET W-scores. (C) Across the presymptomatic and prodromal AD cohorts, we estimated the sequence of regional tau-PET positivity in a data-driven, pseudo-longitud inal manner, using the group-level frequency distribution to infer the order. Subjects were sorted based on the number of tau-PET-positive ROIs, and tau- PET- positive regions in subjects representing the pre-acceleration, acceleration, and post-acceleration periods are shown. The acceleration period was de\ufb01ned as beginning where the slope in the frequency graph becomes greater than two and ending where that slope shows a second in\ufb02ection, such that the secondderivative becomes zero. Number labels on magni\ufb01ed insets (B and C) show ranks, within each hemisphere, from the frequency distribution of tau-PET po sitivity. This approach identi\ufb01es the entorhinal cortex (region labeled 1 in insets) as the most frequently tau-positive region, in keeping with cross-sectio nal neuro- pathological data ( Braak and Braak, 1991 ).

The tau regional spreading order was generally robust across a", "range of tau W-score thresholds ( Figure S1 ), and the key \ufb01ndings shown in Figure 1 were replicated in an independent sample of older subjects from across the AD clinical spectrum (henceforth, \u2018\u2018Korean validation dataset,\u2019\u2019 see STAR Methods andFigures S1 and S2). Importantly, the Korean validation dataset included a larger proportion of subjects with more advanced clinical AD (see Table 1 ), suggesting that the identi\ufb01ed acceleration phase did not result simply from analyzing an ADNI sample skewedtoward early AD stages. A network \ufb02ow-based model identi\ufb01es the inferior temporal gyri as key tau propagation hubsTo clarify the anatomical basis for accelerated tau spreading, we used diffusion tensor imaging to construct a normative \u2018\u2018connec- tome,\u2019\u2019 a matrix describing the group-level structural connectiv-ity between each pair of brain regions. We then used this connectome to create a network \ufb02ow-based model for simu- lating tau propagation along region-to-region macro-scaleconnections ( Figure 2 A). This model enabled us to identify brain regions well positioned to promote widespread tau aggregation(henceforth, \u2018\u2018propagation hubs\u2019\u2019) and to clarify how A bdeposi- tion relates to initial and accelerated tau spreading. Applying the principles of graph theory, we modeled connectivity-medi-ated tau spreading based on maximum inter-nodal \ufb02ow, which considers multiple distinct paths between any two nodes ( Fig- ure 2 A). We then searched a pool of 213 regions, after removing regions prone to off-target tau-PET binding (i.e., radiotracer binding to non-tau targets; see Table S2 ), with the goal of iden- tifying tau propagation hubs. Speci\ufb01cally, we searched a libraryof normative network \ufb02ow-based connectivity maps, eachbased on a single candidate brain region or \u2018\u2018seed\u2019\u2019 ( Figure 2 B), seeking to identify regions whose connectivity most resembles the regions into which tau spreads during the tau accelerationphase. To this end, we estimated the goodness-of-\ufb01t (GOF) between each seed\u2019s map and the topography of the tau accel- eration phase, representing the tau acceleration phase by gener-ating seven pairs of binary inner and outer masks across a range of spatial extents. Masks were gradually expanded to mimic tau propagation ( Figure S3 ) and to avoid potential in\ufb02uences ofTable 1.

Finally, we identi\ufb01ed propagation hubs, using a stringent set of criteria, as thosenodes with signi\ufb01cant GOF scores (permutation-based one- sample t test, Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05) across all seven inner/outer mask pairs (see STAR Methods ). Based on this brain-wide search strategy, the left and right ITG emerged, inde- pendently, as propagation hubs ( Figure 2 C), and this \ufb01nding was stable after varying the total number of inner/outer mask pairsused to represent the acceleration phase ( Table S3 ). As expected, the network \ufb02ow-based connectivity maps seeded by these ITG propagation hubs were strongly correlatedwith the topography of tau deposition seen in subjects repre-senting the tau acceleration phase (contrasted with pre-acceler- ation phase subjects; Figures 3 A and 3B; see STAR Methods ), and those correlations were stronger than seen for other brainregions (based on null hypothesis distributions; Figure 3 C) (Scott et al., 2020 ). Compared with other network-based propagation models developed through our previous work ( Brown et al., 2019 ;Zhou et al., 2012 ), the network \ufb02ow-based model pro- duced the highest correlations between the ITG propagation hub connectivity pattern and the acceleration phase taudeposition topography (see Figure S4 ), justifying our use of the network \ufb02ow-based model for propagation hub identi\ufb01cation.Applying the same propagation hub identi\ufb01cation procedure to the Korean validation dataset, we again identi\ufb01ed the two ADNI-derived ITG areas, and the connectivity of these regionscorrelated strongly with the pattern of acceleration phase tau deposition topography ( Figure S4 B). We also identi\ufb01ed three additional putative propagation hubs,", "all within the ITG regionsbilaterally (see Figure S5 ). Because tau-PET image analysis methods continue to evolve, we also reproduced these key \ufb01ndings after varying several methodological steps that remainunsettled in the \ufb01eld (see Tables S4 andS5). Remote and local A b-tau interactions are associated with initial and accelerated tau spreadingAD has been conceptualized as an A b-triggered tauopathy (Musiek and Holtzman, 2012 ), but to date it has been dif\ufb01cult to reconcile this concept with the topographical discordancebetween early A band tau deposition in humans. Having (1) con\ufb01rmed the EC as the forebrain region from which initial tau spreading occurs and (2) identi\ufb01ed the bilateral ITG regions as Figure 2. A network \ufb02ow-based tau spreading model identi\ufb01es tau propagation hubs in the inferior temporal gyri (A) A simpli\ufb01ed network graph illustrates the network \ufb02ow-based propagation model of tau spreading. Circles represent brain regions (nodes), and li nes represent structural connections between node pairs (edges). The network \ufb02ow-based model adopts a de\ufb01nition of maximum inter-nodal \ufb02ow, which considers mult iple distinct paths. Tau spreading from node ito node jis proportional to the total \ufb02ow value, which is calculated as the sum of the maximum \ufb02ow for each possible path.(B) Searching across all brain regions (examples in yellow shading), propagation hubs were identi\ufb01ed based on the goodness-of-\ufb01t (GOF) of their netw ork \ufb02ow- based connectivity maps, derived from healthy controls, to 7 pairs of binary inner/outer masks de\ufb01ned using the regions that represent the tau accele ration phase (see Figure 1 C and STAR Methods ; GOF scores from example seed ROIs are shown).

To this end, we developed a network-based model to estimate two types of A b-tau interaction: remote and local ( Figure 4 A). Remote interactions were conceived as arising from each tau-positive region\u2019s connectivity to A b-positive re- gions. More speci\ufb01cally, we imagined that tau-positive regionscontain tau-positive neurons, whose axons travel to and form syn-apses with neurons residing in A b-positive regions. Speci\ufb01c A b species may, in turn, prove toxic to those synapses or may other- wise in\ufb02uence axons arriving from or departing to remotely con-nected, tau-positive neurons, thereby triggering a long-range interaction with the tau-positive region. Local interaction, by contrast, was conceived as the direct co-mingling of parenchymalAband aggregating tau within a given brain region ( He et al., 2018 ). Calculation of remote A b-tau interactions required three steps. First, we calculated each region of interest\u2019s weightedconnectivity strength, derived from the healthy structural con- nectome, to all other regions. Second, we multiplied each con- nectivity strength by the magnitude of A b-deposition within the connected region", "and summed these products to calculate aconnectivity-weighted remote A bin\ufb02uence metric. Finally, the remote A bin\ufb02uence metric was multiplied by the magnitude of tau deposition within the region of interest ( Figure 4 A). To rank re- gions according to their remote A b-tau interactions, we again applied the frequency distribution method, assuming that re- gions with the earliest remote A b-tau interactions would be those in which these connectivity-mediated interactions were detectedin the largest proportion of patients (see STAR Methods ). Using this approach, we found that the lateral EC (A35/36r) ranked \ufb01rst among 213 brain regions ( Figures 4 B and S7). Based on absolute levels, the lateral EC showed signi\ufb01cantly greater remote A b-tau interaction than the median of all other brain regions ( t: 3.63/2.61, FDR-corrected p value: 0.001/0.017, left/right EC). This \ufb01nding Figure 3. Inferior temporal gyrus connectivity mirrors tau acceleration phase topography (A) Using the network \ufb02ow-based model, we examined the connectivity patterns of the two inferior temporal gyrus regions (highlighted in yellow) iden ti\ufb01ed as propagation hubs. The connectivity maps of these hubs resembled the acceleration phase tau deposition topography, derived by averaging W-score contrasts across all 1,560 subject pairs representing the acceleration and pre-acceleration phases.(B) The connectivity values and the acceleration phase tau deposition topography map show high spatial correlation for both hemispheres.(C) Null hypothesis distributions are shown for spatial correlations between the total network \ufb02ow-based maps and acceleration phase tau depositio n topog- raphy. The correlation coef\ufb01cients were converted to Z-scores, and the corresponding one-tailed p values were obtained for the two ITG propagation hubs. The red areas show correlation coef\ufb01cients more than 2 SD greater than the mean.

Robustness of this \ufb01nding across a range ofW-score thresholds was even more evident in the Korean vali- dation dataset, perhaps because this dataset represents a morehomogeneous cohort evaluated at a single center. To calculate local A b-tau interactions, we multiplied each re- gion\u2019s local A bdeposition (amyloid-PET standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] value) by its tau-PET W-score. Although the procedures for calculating local A b-tau interactions and those for identifying propagation hubs were completely independent,the left and right ITG propagation hubs emerged as the highest- ranking regions, brain-wide, for local A b-tau interaction (Figures 4 B and S7). Local A b-tau interaction scores for the left and right ITG were signi\ufb01cantly greater than the median of all otherregions ( t: 3.77/4.28, FDR-corrected p value: <0.001/<0.001, left/ right ITG). This \ufb01nding was stable across a range of tau W-score thresholds ( Figure", "S6 ) and alternative tau-PET analysis methods (Tables S4 andS5). These \ufb01ndings were also broadly reproduced in the Korean validation dataset ( Figures S6 andS7), in which the ITG hubs for each hemisphere ranked in the top 4 for local A b-tau interaction within that hemisphere (ITG7, right: 4 th; ITG4, left: 3rd), with the few higher-ranking regions being adjacent basal tempo- ral areas.Longitudinal tau aggregation trajectories support the Ab-tau interaction model In the preceding analyses, we used cross-sectional data to make longitudinal inferences about the natural history of AD. This strat-egy enabled us to derive a regional tau spreading order based on a suf\ufb01cient sample size; nonetheless, the pseudo-longitudinal approach cannot directly test the within-subjects temporalpredictions made by our model. To address this limitation,we collected all subjects in the ADNI (n = 135) and Korean (n = 169) cohorts who had undergone at least one follow-up structural MRI and tau-PET scan (see Table 1 ). Since the two lon- gitudinal samples were relatively small, we combined them into a single ADNI/Korean longitudinal MCI cohort after regularizing the two datasets separately using the W-score approach (see STAR Methods ). Using this combined cohort, we \ufb01rst determined the regional tau accumulation rate, de\ufb01ned as the annualized change in the tau-PET W-score. As expected, tau accumulation in subjects with A b+ MCI (n = 68) is most prominent in basal tem- poral areas and, to a lesser extent, in fronto-parietal heteromodal association cortices ( Figure 5 A). Next, we returned to our library of normative network \ufb02ow-based maps, one derived from eachbrain region, to determine the spatial correlation between each region\u2019s connectivity pattern and the longitudinal tau accumula- tion seen in A b+ MCI. Remarkably, mirroring the cross-sectional \ufb01ndings, the ITG regions again stood out as the regions whose connectivity best matched the longitudinal tau accumulation pattern ( Figure 5 A). Figure 4. Network-based A b-tau interaction model (A) Ab-tau interactions were modeled using two interaction types: remote and local. Remote interaction measures the effect of A bdeposition within regions to which a given region is connected, weighted by the strength of those connections, whereas local interaction requires the presence of A band tau deposition within the same region.(B) For remote A b-tau interactions, the lateral EC regions ranked \ufb01rst within the frequency distribution for each hemisphere. By contrast, the identi\ufb01ed left and rig ht ITG propagation hubs ranked \ufb01rst and second for local A b-tau interaction frequency within left and right hemisphere, respectively. T-statistic distributions of continuous remote A b-tau and local A b-tau interaction values also show greater interactions in the lateral EC and ITG, respectively, compared with other brain regions.

We then used these thresholds to group subjects, irrespective of their clinicallabel, based on", "their baseline A band tau status in the bilateral EC and ITG regions of interest previously identi\ufb01ed through thecross-sectional remote and local A b-tau interaction analyses. We quanti\ufb01ed tau spreading into downstream regions by averaging the annualized tau accumulation rates within the 30 Figure 5. Longitudinal support for the network-based A b-tau interaction model (A) In A b+ MCI subjects, tau-PET showed longitudinal tau accumulation in a regional pattern that strongly correlated with the network \ufb02ow-based connectivit y maps of the ITG propagation hubs. Correlation coef\ufb01cients describing the relationship between each brain region\u2019s connectivity map and the A b+ MCI tau accumulation map were converted to Z-scores and used to form a null hypothesis distribution; one-tailed p values were computed for the two ITG hubs. The red bars in the histogram show correlation coef\ufb01cients more than 2 SD greater than the mean. (B and C) The A b-tau interaction model was assessed longitudinally with the EC and ITG using the entire longitudinal dataset. For the EC (B), the subjects were classi\ufb01ed into 4 subgroups according to the status of each region with respect to local A band tau at baseline. In subjects with tau in the EC at baseline, local EC A b showed no effect on tau spreading (two sample t tests, p value > 0.05). In subjects who lacked EC A b, however, those with remote, connectivity-based A b-tau interaction showed dramatically higher tau spreading than those without (Mann-Whitney U test, one tailed p value < 0.05; B, inset). By contrast, for t he ITG regions (C), a transition to local A b-tau interaction was associated with signi\ufb01cantly greater longitudinal tau accumulation in downstream regions (Mann-Whitney U test, p value < 0.05; C, inset).

For the EC, we predicted that downstream tau spreading would be greatest when the EC is tau-positive at baseline, with little in\ufb02uence by thelocal co-presence of A b. Critically, however, our model predicts that regions downstream of the EC will show greater tau accu- mulation insofar as the EC is subjected to remote A b-tau interac- tion. Each of these EC-based predictions was supported by ourlongitudinal data ( Figure 5 B;t: 0.32//C00.98, p value: 0.749/0.330, left/right EC, for in\ufb02uence of local A b; Mann-Whitney U test Z: 1.73/2.73, one-tailed p value: 0.041/0.003, left/right EC; for in\ufb02u-ence of remote A b;Figure 5 B inset). Regarding the ITG propaga- tion hubs, our model predicts accelerated tau spreading when Aband tau interact locally within the ITG. Here, we found that re- gions downstream of the ITG accumulated more tau in subjects who transitioned from having only A bin the ITG", "to having both A b and tau ( Figure 5 C, inset; Mann-Whitney U test Z: 4.23/4.04, p value: <0.001/<0.001, left/right ITG, for the in\ufb02uence of emergingAb-tau co-positivity). Emergent A b-tau co-positivity in the ITG was invariably the result of an A b-positive ITG that became tau-positive at follow-up. The longitudinal EC and ITG \ufb01ndingsreported here were stable across a range of downstream region numbers ( Table S6 ). Two pivotal A b-tau interactions in the natural history of ADThe \ufb01ndings outlined above suggest two major in\ufb02ection points in the molecular-anatomical pathogenesis of AD. The \ufb01rst oc- curs when neocortical A bemerges within multiple neocortical and limbic regions connected to the entorhinal cortices. This remote, connectivity-mediated interaction between A band EC tau may induce tau to undergo biophysical changes that propelit to spread out of the entorhinal areas and into nearby, con- nected regions in the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal tem- poral cortices. The second pivotal moment occurs when tauneuro\ufb01brillary changes reach the ITG, where tau can locally interact, for the \ufb01rst time, with pre-existing A b, catalyzing wide- spread tau propagation into A b-positive and ITG-connected neocortical regions whose degeneration ultimately gives riseto dementia ( Sepulcre et al., 2018 ). If these A b-tau interactions occur in sequence, as we hypothesize, then metrics capturing these two phenomena should obey a nonlinear relationship inwhich the EC remote A b-tau interaction rises \ufb01rst, before giving way to a rise in local A b-tau interaction within the ITG ( Figure 6 A; seeSTAR Methods ). Plotting these metrics across our discov- ery and validation cohorts, using cross-sectional and longitudi- nal data, strongly supported this prediction, demonstrating a fundamental arc of disease progression across and withinindividuals ( Figure 6 B). Quadratic regression models based on the mean (left/right) cross-sectional values \ufb01t both datasets well (ADNI: R2= 0.664, Korean: R2= 0.652), signi\ufb01cantly better than did linear functions (ADNI: R2= 0.658 / F [testing for the dif- ference between quadratic and linear \ufb01t] = 7.022, p = 0.008; Korean: R2= 0.541 / F = 108.02, p = 2e-16) ( Indrayan and Malhotra, 2017 ). Focusing these analyses on subjects with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele further emphasized the nonlinear relationship (ADNI: R2= 0.748 / F [testing for the difference between quadratic and linear \ufb01t] = 8.042, p = 0.005; Korean:R2= 0.630 / F = 26.83, p = 1e-6), perhaps because APOE \u03b54 carriers more often develop a typical anatomical progression that begins in medial temporal lobe memory structures ( Wolk et al., 2010 ). Based on the two pivotal A b-tau interactions, we strati\ufb01ed sub- jects into one of four groups: (1) \u2018\u2018tau-negative\u2019\u2019 in EC; (2) insuf\ufb01- cient EC remote A b-tau interaction to promote tau spreading (\u2018\u2018latent tau\u2019\u2019); (3) suf\ufb01cient EC remote A b-tau interaction but min- imal ITG local A b-tau interaction (\u2018\u2018spreading tau\u2019\u2019); and (4) suf\ufb01- cient ITG local A b-tau interaction (\u2018\u2018propagating tau\u2019\u2019). Figure 6 C shows subject strati\ufb01cation assignments overlaid on thepseudo-longitudinal subject order derived from the tau frequency", "distribution approach. Using this strati\ufb01cation method, subjects assigned to the \u2018\u2018spreading tau\u2019\u2019 group are found just before orshortly after the start of the tau acceleration phase, whereas those designated \u2018\u2018propagating tau\u2019\u2019 are nearly all found within and beyond the acceleration phase. As expected, longitudinalsubjects within the \u2018\u2018spreading\u2019\u2019 and, in particular, \u2018\u2018propagating\u2019\u2019tau groups showed dramatically greater whole-brain annualized tau accumulation ( Figure 6 D). Expert recommendations for the use of the amyloid-lowering drug, aducanumab, emphasize theimportance of positive AD biomarkers and a clinical label of MCI or mild dementia ( Cummings and Salloway, 2021 ). There- fore, it is important to note that the model-driven subject strati\ufb01-cation method presented here overlays inconsistently on the biomarker-anchored clinical groupings conventionally used in AD clinical trials ( Figure 6 E;Table S7 ). For example, subjects in the \u2018\u2018spreading tau\u2019\u2019 group, whom we hypothesize will bene\ufb01t most from amyloid-lowering therapy, represent only 14.4% of the overall A b+ MCI group. These \ufb01ndings raise the possibility that a molecular-anatomical de\ufb01nition of disease stage mayoutperform clinical labels in predicting clinical responsiveness to amyloid-lowering and other AD therapies. DISCUSSIONFor decades, AD researchers have questioned how remote A b can stimulate neuro\ufb01brillary tauopathy to spread beyond themedial temporal lobe during the preclinical stages of AD ( Musiek and Holtzman, 2012 ;Jagust, 2018 ). The present work shows that these early A b-tau interactions are likely mediated, at least in part, by long-range neural connections between the EC andbrain regions in which early A bdeposition occurs. More recent neuroimaging studies have emphasized a tau acceleration phase, in which frontal, temporal, and parietal heteromodal as-sociation cortex tauopathy takes hold in patients with late MCI, heralding the transition to dementia ( Sanchez et al., 2021a , 2021b ). Our \ufb01ndings identify the bilateral ITG regions as key propagation hubs whose connectional pro\ufb01les are poised to disseminate tau throughout the neocortex, perhaps facilitated by local A b-tau interactions. Tau spreading mechanisms remain a focus of intensive study, and transneuronal spreading is but one among several proposed mechanisms. The present neuroimaging analyses, conducted at the spatial resolution of brain regions and major \ufb01ber pathways,were not designed to address all potential cellular mechanisms or to estimate their relative contributions. Rather, we worked from the assumption that transneuronal spreading makes atll Article Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943, June 15, 2022 1939 least some contribution to tau progression in AD even if other factors, such as shared regional vulnerability, local spreading, and other mechanisms contribute. In that regard, it is somewhat remarkable that a model based on transneuronal spreadingprovides such a strong \ufb01t to the experimental data. Nonetheless, not all of our \ufb01ndings \ufb01t the connectivity-based model. For example, not all participants with early AD conformed to thetau spreading pseudo-order derived from cross-sectional tau- PET data ( Figure 1 C). This variability may re\ufb02ect heterogeneous AD anatomical trajectories ( Vogel et al., 2021 ), connectivity-inde-pendent tau spreading mechanisms, or a combination of these factors. Although our longitudinal data strongly supported the temporal predictions of our model, we observed some", "overlap in tau accumulation rates among patients who did or did notbecome newly co-positive for A band tau in the ITG propagation hubs at follow-up ( Figure 5 C). This overlap could re\ufb02ect involve- ment of non-ITG propagation hubs, PET tracer insensitivity toearly tau deposition, or connectivity-independent tau progres- sion. Additional research is needed to resolve these possibilities and to further re\ufb01ne the model proposed here. Figure 6.

(B) Each subject\u2019s data are plotted, with an arrow connecting the baseline and follow-up scans (arrowhead points to later timepoint) where available . The nonlinear relationship between metrics representing EC remote A b-tau interaction and ITG local A b-tau interaction support the notion that these phenomena represent a temporal progression.(C) Subjects were strati\ufb01ed into four groups and overlaid on the pseudo-longitudinal subject order derived from the tau frequency distribution appr oach. Group color-coding in (B) and (C) indicates four tau group assignments at baseline.(D) Annualized longitudinal tau W-score change maps, strati\ufb01ed by baseline tau group assignment, demonstrate the dramatic increase in tau spreading in the propagating tau group.(E) Subjects from the ADNI and Korean validation cohorts were strati\ufb01ed into 4 groups within each biomarker-anchored clinical label.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography methods can result in errone- ously estimated connections ( Maier-Hein et al., 2017 ), and ear- ly-stage AD may alter the connectome in ways that could in\ufb02u- ence our model-based predictions. As in our previous work (Zhou et al., 2012 ;Brown et al., 2019 ), we used the normative connectome to model disease spreading based on the assump-tion that major changes in the fundamental connectome architecture are unlikely even if individual edge weights may be in\ufb02uenced by disease. Furthermore, we employed a network\ufb02ow-based tau spreading model; this model re\ufb02ects all possible paths between source and target regions, providing robustness to minor errors in single-edge connectivity estimation. A nextstep in the development of this model will be to incorporate indi- vidual patient functional and/or structural connectomes to eval- uate whether and how disease-related connectivity changesmodulate tau spreading. Conclusion Our \ufb01ndings address a long-standing question about thepathogenesis and progressi on of AD by placing early A b-tau interactions within a connectiv ity-based molecular-anatomical framework. This framework suggests that the natural historyof AD traverses a critical period that begins once A bemerges within EC-connected regions, continues as tau spreads from the EC into connected mesial temporal and limbic regions,and may end once A band tau interact within the ITG propaga- tion hubs, whose connections are well suited to facilitate widespread neocortical tau propagation. The ef\ufb01cacy ofAb-lowering drugs may depend on the timing of their delivery (Mintun et al., 2021 ),", "and the critical period de\ufb01ned here can now be evaluated as a potential therapeutic window. Additional work is needed to determine whether subject strat-i\ufb01cation methods based on this model can help predict responsiveness to A b-lowering and other AD therapeutic strategies.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Participants We included participants from two non-overlapping datasets for this study: the discovery dataset and the validation dataset. The discovery dataset consisted of participants from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ) and includes patients with AD-type dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal age-matched controls. All participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) using18F-\ufb02or- betapir (AV45) for A band18F-\ufb02ortaucipir (AV1451) scans for tau. 187 cognitively normal (CN) subjects, 64 patients with early MCI (early MCI), 30 patients with late MCI (late MCI), and 11 patients with AD dementia were used for the discovery dataset. Detailed diag-nostic criteria were previously reported ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/ )(Petersen et al., 2010 ). Of the 292 subjects available, four CN subjects, one early MCI patient, and two AD-type dementia patients were excluded due to poor co-registration quality between MRI and PET scans. One early MCI patient and one CN subject were excluded due to poor pre-processing during", "Freesurfer-basedimage analysis. The ADNI sample size for the main analyses was 283 ( Table 1 ). We also included 95 CN subjects from ADNI to construct the healthy structural connectome. These participants satis\ufb01ed identical diagnostic criteria as the previous CN subjects but were chosen because they had undergone structural MRI scans and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) scans suitable for diffusiontractography. Of these 95 subjects, 49 were also included in the discovery dataset used for PET analysis. The validation dataset included participants clinically diagnosed at Gangnam Severance Hospital, South Korea, from January 2015 to July 2016 ( Table 1 ). This study was approved by the institutional review board of Gangnam Severance Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All participants in the validation dataset underwent structural MRI, as well as 18F-\ufb02orbetaben PET for A band18F-\ufb02ortaucipir PET for tau. The participants included 96 CN subjects showing normal performance on neuropsychological tests and no abnormalities on brain MRI, as well as 84 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and 71 with AD-typedementia ful\ufb01lling the National Institute on Aging\u2013Alzheimer Association diagnostic criteria for \u2018\u2018MCI due to AD with intermediate orhigh likelihood\u2019\u2019 ( Albert et al., 2011 ) and \u2018\u2018probable dementia with evidence of the AD pathophysiologic process\u2019\u2019 ( McKhann et al., 2011 ), respectively.

All participants had baseline scans satisfying the same criteria used for the cross-sectional analyses and had undergone follow-up structural MRI and \ufb02ortaucipir PET scans. Due to the limited samples available, we included all MCI subjects and considered early and late MCI together (Table 1 ). With 19 newly added subjects after excluding 4 due to image co-registration errors, 72 CN subjects, 55 patients with MCI (amyloid-PET-positive: 32), and 8 patients with AD dementia were available for the ADNI discovery dataset. In the Korean validation dataset, 169 participants including 74 CN subjects, 59 patients with amnestic MCI (amyloid-PET-positive: 36), and 36 patients with dementia (amyloid-PET-positive: 28) had follow-up scans. After calculating mean annualized change in tau-PET W-scores across all ROIs, four subjects with extreme outlier values, de\ufb01ned as any values more than 3 times the interquartile range above the thirdquartile, were removed from the longitudinal analyses ( Hoaglin et al., 2000 ). METHOD DETAILSImage acquisition For the discovery (ADNI) dataset, structural MRI and PET scans were downloaded on April 2019 from the ADNI repository. StructuralMRIs were acquired in ADNI-2 and ADNI-3 phases using 3T MRI scanners with 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) or inversion recovery-fast spoiled gradient recalled (IR-SPGR) sequences. Detailed protocols of MRI scanner for T1-weighted", "imaging can be found online ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols/ ). Florbetapir PET scans were acquired for 20 minutes (4 35 min frames) at 50-70 min post injection of 10 mCi tracers, and Flortaucipir PET scans were acquired for 30 min (6 35 min frames) at 75-105 min post injection of 10 mCi tracers. We only used MRI scans having the shortest interval between MRI and Flortaucipir PET acquisition, all within six months (37 \u00b1 40 days) of each other. Florbetapir images were used if acquired within 1 year of Flortaucipir (23 \u00b1 38 days), in keeping with previous approaches ( Das et al., 2018 ;Maass et al., 2017 ). DWI had the same acquisition date as the corresponding T 1-weighted MRI. Multiple b=0 s/mm2images and 48 b=1000 s/mm2images were acquired for DWI with 2 3232m m3voxels in ADNI-3 phase ( http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/ ). In the valida- tion (Korean) dataset, T 1-weighted MRI was also obtained using a 3T MR scanner with 3D SPGR sequence. Each of the Florbetaben and Flortaucipir PET scans was acquired for 20 minutes on separate days at 90 min and 80 minutes after the injection of tracers, respectively. Detailed acquisition parameters have been described ( Cho et al., 2019 ). PET image processing Each A b- and tau-PET image for both baseline and follow-up scans was preprocessed as follows ( Vogel et al., 2021 ). The raw PET image was \ufb01rst co-registered between frames to reduce motion effects with conversion to DICOM format and processed byaveraging \ufb01ve-minute frames. The generated images were then reoriented into a standard 160 3160396 voxel image grid with 1.5 mm cubic voxels and intensity normalized. Finally, smoothing was performed with a scanner-speci\ufb01c \ufb01lter function to make a uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm full width at half maximum ( Jagust et al., 2015 )(http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ). PET images were co-registered to the corresponding T1 image using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) Linear Registration Tool (FLIRT). For eachhemisphere, we used the atlas parcellation comprising 105 cerebral cortical and 18 subcortical brain regions de\ufb01ned by the Brainnetome atlas ( Fan et al., 2016 ), which was reverse-normalized to each participant\u2019s structural MRI scan. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were obtained using whole cerebellum as a reference region. The voxel values assigned to a previouslyidenti\ufb01ed region-of-interest (ROI) were averaged to obtain a regional SUVR value. The global retention ratio for Florbetapir images was computed based on A b-related regions including the frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal regions ( Jagust et al., 2015 ). Subjects were classi\ufb01ed as amyloid-positive when the global Florbetapir retention ratio exceeded 1.11, consistent with previous approaches ( Joshi et al., 2012 )(http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ). Structural network construction Structural networks were constructed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques, based on eddy-current-corrected diffusion-weighted MR images (FSL, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/ ). Each structural network consisted of nodes (brain regions) and edges (connections between node pairs). For each hemisphere, the nodes comprised the 105 cerebral cortical and 18 subcortical brain regions de\ufb01ned by the Brainnetome atlas ( Fan", "et al., 2016 ). T1-weighted MR image volumes from the Brainnetome atlas were resampled to corresponding eddy-current-corrected diffusion-weighted MR image volumes using FreeSurfer ( http://surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/ ) to specify the nodes of each structural network. We derived the structural connectivity matrix at both individual and group levels. An individual-level network edge was deemed present if there was at least one streamline between a node pair,acquired by whole-brain deterministic tractography using the second order Runge-Kutta algorithm through the Diffusion toolkit (Wang et al., 2007 ). Fiber tracking was initiated at the 8 random points of each seed voxel with a fractional anisotropy (FA) > 0.3 and ended at the voxels with FA < 0.2 or a tract turning angle of > 45 degrees. The strength of each edge was determined basedon the FA values averaged across all connecting streamlines using the UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Package ( https://github. com/jbrown81/umcp )(van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011 ). FA values have been considered to represent the level of microstructural organization of white matter tracts ( Beaulieu, 2002 ), which has been associated with the functional ef\ufb01cacy of the connectionsll Article Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943.e1\u2013e5, June 15, 2022 e2 (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 2006 ;Gold et al., 2007 ). The group-level network was computed by averaging individual network edges present in more than a third of all healthy (A b- CN) subjects. In the group-level network, 4.68% of edges were connected, and their range of mean FA values was 0.2215 [0.1766, 0.2842] (median [Q1, Q3]). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Determination of individual tau-PET pattern We employed gaussian mixture modeling for each ROI to address off-target Flortaucipir binding ( Choi et al., 2018 ;Lemoine et al., 2018 ;Lockhart et al., 2017 ). Following previous approaches ( Vogel et al., 2020 ), we assumed that a distribution of pathological signal would be skewed while those of off-target and non-speci\ufb01c signals would remain normally distributed across the study sample. All Flortaucipir SUVR values of each ROI were \ufb01tted through a one-component and a two-component gaussian mixture model, of whichthe results were compared \ufb01ve times using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Consistently lower BIC in a one-component model than a two-component model indicates SUVR values of the region are roughly normally distributed, implying no evidence of patho- logical tau deposition. The regions \ufb01tted better with a one-component model were considered as not or not yet involved in tauopathy,so not included in the study (33 brain regions were regarded as off-target regions for the ADNI dataset and 46 for the Korean validation dataset; see Table S2 ). We then constructed a W-score map ( Jack et al., 1997 ;La Joie et al., 2012 ;Ossenkoppele et al., 2015 ) for each Flortaucipir PET image to represent individual pathological tau burden compared to the amyloid-PET-negative CN group ( Tsai et al., 2019 ).W-scores are standardized values adjusted for covariates including age, sex, and years of education. For each ROI, a linear regression was performed between the covariates and the regional SUVR values in the control", "group. The W-score was computed as a difference between actual and predicted pathological burden (i.e. the residual) of each subject, divided by the standard deviation of residuals inthe control group. In the individual W-score maps generated for Flortaucipir PET scans, greater values indicate greater Flortaucipir uptake, suggesting greater tau pathological burden. Determination of pseudo-longitudinal order To study the non-linear acceleration of tau aggregation required the use of cross-sectional data to make longitudinal inferences. To this end, we \ufb01rst constructed a pseudo-longitudinal order by applying a frequency-based method to the tau-PET data of presymp-tomatic and prodromal AD (A b-positive CN and MCI, early or late) subjects. ROIs were ordered to de\ufb01ne a regional tau spreading order by the frequencies with which the regional W-scores exceeded a given threshold across all subjects. We used a W-score threshold of 2.5, following previous research ( Cho et al., 2016 ), but other thresholds were also considered to evaluate robustness (see Figure S1 ). Subjects were sorted based on their number of ROIs having suprathreshold tau W-scores. To determine the period in which tau acceleration occurs, we used a smoothed line of the frequency graph based on the pseudo-longitudinal order. We deemed that the acceleration phase begins where the slope of the graph becomes larger than two and ends at the second in\ufb02ection point, where the second derivative become zero. Network \ufb02ow-based connectivity derivation We constructed a \ufb02ow-based network based on maximum inter-nodal \ufb02ow, using the whole-brain structural network to model theextent of tau propagation between each node pair. Every possible non-overlapping distinct path between any two nodes was ex- tracted by employing a graph-theoretical maximum-\ufb02ow calculation method using the binary normative brain network ( Wook Yoo et al., 2015 ;Wilson, 1979 ). Each separate path contributed to the total inter-nodal \ufb02ow by the amount of the mean FA value of all edges in the path divided by the average inter-nodal streamline length in mm. The partial contributions were then combined throughall distinct paths, which became an edge weight between the source and sink nodes in the \ufb02ow-based connectivity matrix. By adopt- ing multiple distinct paths between two nodes, the \ufb02ow-based network provides a method for predicting the physical amount of tau delivered from the source to sink node. This \ufb02ow network was constructed at both the individual and group levels using the healthystructural connectome. Propagation hub identi\ufb01cation The \ufb02ow-based network described above was next used to identify propagation hubs, hypothesized to drive the acceleration phase of tau spreading. To this end, we searched a library of network \ufb02ow-based connectivity maps, one seeded by each of the 246 brain regions-of-interest, and we estimated the goodness-of-\ufb01t (GOF) of each seed\u2019s map to the progression of tau through the regionsrepresenting the tau acceleration phase. Speci\ufb01cally, binary inner and outer masks were de\ufb01ned within the tau acceleration phase regions across a range of thresholds (see Figure S3 ). Assuming that the propagation hubs template the topography of acceleration phase tau spreading, the inner and outer mask regions were", "constrained to tau acceleration phase regions, arranged using thepseudo-longitudinal regional tau spreading order. We assigned the \ufb01rst thirty brain regions to the inner mask and the next thirtyregions to the outer mask to capture earlier and later tau spreading. The inner mask was then gradually expanded by ten regions, producing 7 different sets of inner-outer mask pairs (see Figure S3 ), to mimic tau propagation and to avoid potential in\ufb02uence of arbitrary thresholding. For example, the second mask set had the \ufb01rst forty regions as the inner mask and the next thirty regionsas the outer mask. A GOF score was calculated for each seed by subtracting its average connectivity to the outer mask areall Article e3Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943.e1\u2013e5, June 15, 2022 from its average connectivity to the inner mask area., and a permutation-based one-sample t-test was performed using the GOF scores. The signi\ufb01cance level was determined using p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple tests. The propagation hubs were identi\ufb01ed as the regions showing signi\ufb01cant GOF scores for all 7 mask pairs. In this way, regions that show the highest and most robust connectivity to regions that become tau-positive early in the acceleration phase were selected as propagation hubs. Statistical evaluation of network spread To assess the relationship between the network \ufb02ow-based connectivity in health and the topographical pattern of tau accelerationphase, we performed correlation analyses between the group-level \ufb02ow network derived from the identi\ufb01ed ITG propagation hubsand the group-level tau-PET W-score contrast maps from ADNI subjects. The tau-PET contrast map was obtained by averaging all possible two-subject tau-PET W-score difference maps from subjects drawn (one each) from the acceleration and pre-acceleration periods. The pre-acceleration period consists of subjects ordered before the acceleration phase, based on the pseudo-longitudinalsubject order, insofar as they had at least one tau-positive region. Correlations were then evaluated in each hemisphere using the ipsilateral propagation hub. To place our \ufb01ndings in context of previous work from our group ( Brown et al., 2019 ;Zhou et al., 2012 ), we compared the network \ufb02ow-based correlations to those derived using shortest path length and Euclidean distance from the propagation hubs. The matrix of shortest path length was computed using group-level FA-weighted structural connectivity, and the Euclidean distances between each pair of nodes were averaged through all healthy subjects. For the correlation analyses, statistical signi\ufb01cance was set to p < 0.05 and multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discoveryrate (FDR) method ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ) across three different measures and the two ITG propagation hubs. Furthermore, we calculated the null distribution of z-transformed correlation coef\ufb01cients using all brain regions as seeds to assess the statistical meaning of the correlation coef\ufb01cient for the ITG propagation hubs compared to other regions in terms of correlation with the topographical tau deposition representing the acceleration > pre-acceleration phase pattern as de\ufb01ned above. Analysis of network-based A b-tau interactions We evaluated the relationship between A band tau based on remote and local interactions. For computing remote interactions of each ROI, A", "b-PET SUVR values in each connected region, based on the structural connectome, were multiplied by the FA value of the connecting tract, inversely weighted by the streamline length, based on the notion that remote interactions will re\ufb02ect the strength of the connection and the distance over which these effects must travel ( Iturria-Medina et al., 2014 ;Waters, 2010 ). The connectivity-weighted A b-PET SUVRs for all connected regions were summed, and this remote A bin\ufb02uence value was then multiplied by the tau W-score of the ROI. In this way, a region\u2019s remote A b-tau interaction was determined by the strength and number of its connections to A b-PET-positive brain areas and by its local tau deposition. Similarly, local A b-tau interactions were obtained by multiplying the region\u2019s A b-PET SUVR by the region\u2019s local tau W-score. For the magnitude of A bdeposition, the regional A b-PET SUVR value was used because of its narrow dynamic range; in this context, W-score normalization may skew or exaggerate small changes in A bdeposition ( Grothe et al., 2017 ). To estimate where the remote and local interactions take place earliest in AD progression, we applied the same frequency-based method used for constructing the pseudo-longitudinal tau spreading order. Brain regions were ordered using the frequencies with which their remote or local A bin\ufb02uence metric was positive and the tau W-score exceeded a given threshold. Both remote A b in\ufb02uence and local A bpositivity were determined using regional cutoff values calculated by employing a previously reported method (Aizenstein et al., 2008 ) that iteratively removes outliers within each region\u2019s data from the A b-negative CN group until no outlier arises and multiplies the maximum of remaining values by a small number as a buffer. We considered the values higher than 1.5 3the interquartile range over the third quartile as outliers and identi\ufb01ed a cutoff value as the 95 thpercentile of the remaining data after removing outliers. In addition, we compared the interaction score of each region with the median interaction scores of all other re-gions from the ipsilateral hemisphere. For this comparison, the continuous values of both interaction scores were used. To address regional variations in A b-PET SUVR across the whole brain, we normalized the remote/local A bin\ufb02uence using the regional cutoffs, which were multiplied by each ROI\u2019s local tau W-score to compute the remote and local A b-tau interaction scores. Permutation- based one-sample t-tests were used across all subjects and multiple comparisons were corrected using the FDR method ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ) across all regions within each hemisphere. To verify robustness of the interaction pseudo-order, we also considered a range of tau thresholds (see Figure S6 ). According to our hypotheses and main results (see Figure 4 ), we assumed that the remote A b-tau interactions occur earliest in the entorhinal cortex and have a critical in\ufb02uence on tau spreading from the EC, whereas local interactions occur early and crucially within the ITG. Therefore, we examined the location of the EC", "on the distribution of t-statistics for remote interaction scores andthe inferior temporal gyrus on the distribution of t-statistics for local interaction scores (see Figures 4 andS7). Longitudinal analyses of tau acceleration To strengthen the statistical power of the longitudinal analyses, we used regional tau W-scores of the ADNI and Korean datasets together. First, to determine whether the connectivity of the ITG stands out as a predictor of longitudinal tau accumulation, we performed correlation analyses between the regional \ufb02ow-based networks, derived from healthy controls, and the group-level annualized change in tau-PET W-maps, derived from A b+ subjects with MCI (n = 68). Off-target regions co-occurring in both datasets were removed from the correlation analyses but retained in network \ufb02ow-based map construction, in keeping with the cross-ll Article Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943.e1\u2013e5, June 15, 2022 e4 sectional analyses. The correlation coef\ufb01cients of all seed regions were transformed to z-scores, and the values of the ITG propa- gation hubs were presented on the distribution (see Figure 5 A). Next, to assess the relationship between the two key A b-tau interactions and longitudinal tau accumulation, subjects were strat- i\ufb01ed by the status of local A band tau for each ROI separately (including both left and right EC and ITG) as follows: (1) both A band tau were negative (-/-), (2) A bwas positive while tau was negative (+/-), (3) A bwas negative while tau was positive (-/+), and (4) both were positive (+/+). Necessarily, for each region-of-interest, groups 1-4 had different subject compositions. For each subject, we deter- mined the tau accumulation rate in regions \u2018\u2018downstream\u2019\u2019 to the region-of-interest, by averaging the annualized change rates acrosstauW-scores among the 30 regions immediately following the region-of-interest within the dataset-speci\ufb01c regional tau spreading order. We \ufb01rst performed two-sample t-tests using the averaged annualized change rates to compare the effects of the EC being Ab-positive vs. A b-negative in the presence of local tau-positivity. For the EC, subjects with negative local A band positive tau were further divided into two subgroups according to the EC remote A b-tau interaction status: remote A b-negative/local tau-positive and remote A b-positive/local tau-positive (see Figure 5 B). The downstream tau accumulation rates of the two subgroups were compared to examine the effects of remote A bon tau within the EC, using a Mann-Whitney U test, appropriate here due to the nonparametric distribution of the tau accumulation rate in these subgroups. We next evaluated the effects of local interaction be-tween A band tau within the ITG ( Figure 5 C). Subjects lacking local tau while having positive A bwithin the ITG were further divided into two sub-groups based on whether tau positivity emerged in the ITG at follow-up. The rationale for this subgrouping was that it would allow us to determine whether arrival of tau at the (already A b-positive) ITG promoted greater downstream tau spreading. We then compared these subgroups using a Mann-Whitney U test. The number of downstream regions assessed in these analyses was\ufb01rst set to 30, but we also addressed effects", "over a range of this parameter from 20 to 50 (see Table S6 ). Network model-based subject strati\ufb01cation Our \ufb01ndings suggested two important transitions during the natural history of AD, based on: (1) remote A b-tau interaction within the lateral EC and (2) local A b-tau interaction within the ITG. To examine subjects\u2019 status with respect to these transitions, we computed quantitative thresholds for each metric. The \ufb01rst threshold was computed by multiplying the regional cutoff of the EC remote A bin- \ufb02uence metric by the tau W-score cutoff (2.5 in our study). Similarly, for the second threshold, the regional cutoff for the ITG local amyloid SUVR was multiplied by the tau W-score cutoff. Using this approach, we classi\ufb01ed each subject into one of four groups: (1) least affected by the tau pathology (\u2018\u2018tau-negative\u2019\u2019) in EC ( Baek et al., 2020 ), (2) subthreshold EC remote A b-tau interaction despite the presence of EC tau (\u2018\u2018latent tau\u2019\u2019 group), (3) suprathreshold EC remote A b-tau interaction but subthreshold ITG A b-tau local inter- action (\u2018\u2018spreading tau\u2019\u2019 group), and (4) suprathreshold ITG A b-tau local interaction (\u2018\u2018propagating tau\u2019\u2019 group). Values for each metric were calculated in each hemisphere separately. Subjects were assigned to the latent tau group if they had subthreshold values inboth hemispheres for Threshold 1, whereas they were strati\ufb01ed to the propagating tau group if they had suprathreshold values inboth hemispheres for Threshold 2. If one hemisphere would yield assignment to the latent tau and the other to propagating tau group, then the subject was assigned to the latent tau group, based on the notion that they might, upon re-testing, move into the spreading tau group as de\ufb01ned.ll Article e5Neuron 110, 1932\u20131943.e1\u2013e5, June 15, 2022"]}
